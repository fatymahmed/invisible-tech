A javascript app that receives an array of cities (their location name or postal code)then logs each city's current time and weather.

I have added the API keys otherwise you would need to generate your own keys for the API, otherwise an ideal way was to provide an env template file and add my keys to the env file.

As mentioned in the test specification, the result is logged to the console.

Open `index.html` file and the result will be logged in the console.

`index.js` file contains a method called `main` which takes in the array of locations as it's input
